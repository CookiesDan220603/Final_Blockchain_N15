# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:
open folder src then run
```shell
npm install
npm start
```

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/00-deploy.js
```
